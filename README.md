# Chat App

This is a web app that displays live text messages. Its design is inspired loosely by Slack.
  
This project was built using React for the front end and Firebase for the back end, as well as other frameworks and libraries such as Tailwind CSS and Font Awesome.

Languages Used:
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript

## Usage

Since this is a web app, all that is needed is to go to the [website](https://jacobziff.github.io/chat/). Once there enter a username to sign in with and select a channel. There are three global channels (#General, #Random, and #Suggestions). There are also private channels. If your user has had recent direct messages with another, they will appear in the list. To add a new user to the direct messages list, click the plus icon and enter their username. The side menu can also be toggled. All messages are automatically deleted **one week** after they are sent.
